# PathFollowing  
PathFollowingRobot  

##Introduction  
A robot for path following  
Github Project: https://github.com/FrozenFeather/PathFollowing  

##Hardware  
**DFRobot RoMeo BLE V1.0**  
**LCD display Monitor with I2C**  
**Motor with Hall encoder**  

##Library  
**Arduino**  
-FreeIMU  
-LiquidCrystal_I2C.h  

##Algorithm  
Input: Path generated by processing, specific coordinates are given  
Process: By calculating the distance and angle of direction, by the use of P controller, required velocity and angular velocity is calculate.
Output: Two wheelsâ€™ revolution speed is calculated by Kinematics from velocity and angular velocity.
Feedback: Using Hall encoder and e-compass to trace the path and the current coordinates are calculated out for the process use.
